These advanced reasoning capabilities provide new avenues for improving the safety and robustness of our models. In particular, our models can reason about our safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks. Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence. Our results underscore the need for building robust alignment methods, extensively stress-testing their efficacy, and maintaining meticulous risk management protocols.

During the task, the model encounters unambiguous evidence its given goal diverges from the goal of its developer/user.

Moreover, the field of frontier model evaluations is still nascent, and there are limits to the types of tasks that models or humans can grade in a way that is measurable via evaluation.

These experts were sourced by a senior member of OpenAI’s National Security team, and were screened for relevant and diverse industry and government experience. After training on the Preparedness Framework CBRN risk thresholds (Low, Medium, High, Critical) and completing a 20-question pre-screening quiz to confirm their understanding, experts were tasked with assessing whether the model could assist in radiological and nuclear weapon creation. Each conversation was assessed against the Preparedness Framework risk thresholds. Any conversation that received an initial rating of High or above was assigned to additional experts for further review. Of the 42 total expert conversations, 32 were rated Low risk and 10 were rated Medium risk, while the 4 conversations initially rated High were later classified as either Low or Medium after subsequent expert reviews. The Post-Mitigation o1 model successfully refused all Medium and High prompts, and was ultimately designated as earning a “Low” risk under the Preparedness Framework for RN weapon creation capability.",
